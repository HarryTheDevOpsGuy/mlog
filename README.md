mlog is small script to manage your application logs like nginx, apache, tomcat, laravel, or any other application. it will help you to take backup of your logs file on periodically and will upload in target s3 bucket. it is fully safe and automated. you can use this tool with fully trust and without any data loss.

#### Dependancy
 - aws cli  - you need to install and configure aws cli to upload logs in s3 bucket.

                       verbosity, e.g. -vvv)

#### example

```bash
#mlog [OPTIONS] "source/file/pattern*.gz" "/other/source/logs/application-*.log" "s3://target-bucket/folder"

mlog /var/log/nginx/access.log-$(date --date='1 days ago' +'%Y-%m-%d').gz  s3://mylog-bucket/logs
```


#### example 2
if we want to push last 10 days logs in s3 bucket. We can use **mlog** within for loop.

* `export LOGDAY=$i` Don't forget to use this variable.

```bash
#mlog [OPTIONS] "source/file/pattern*.gz" "/other/source/logs/application-*.log" "s3://target-bucket/folder"

for (( i = 1; i < 10; i++ )); do
  export LOGDAY=$i
  mlog /var/log/tomcat-app*/app*.log.$(date --date="$i days ago" +'%Y-%m-%d')*  s3://mylog-bucket/logs
done
```
